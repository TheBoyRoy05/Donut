# Donut

Ever wanted to see a spinning donut in your terminal? No? Well, now you can! Just download the .exe file and run it.  Note: Don't download and run random files from strangers! Never heard of stranger danger?? But you can trust me though, I'm a real person who knows what I'm doing ;).

Once you run the .exe file, simply full screen the terminal that pops up and you'll see a spinning donut. It's like a magic trick, but it's real!
